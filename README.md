A visualization framework to be used on the Powerwall to visualize NYC Taxi Data.

by Julius Rauscher & Julia Klein

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Directories

* `Data/`

    contains the scripts used for preprocessing the data.

* `Presentations/`

    contains the slides for the weekly presentations.

* `src/`

    contains the necessary files to compile the React App. 

* `build/`

    contains the optimized build. 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the required modules to run this application.<br />

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `serve -s build`

Runs the optimized build.
(Perhaps installing the serve package via `npm install serve` is necessary.)<br />
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.
